This project demonstrated the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop a spell-correcting chatbot aimed at assisting non-native English learners in improving their vocabulary and writing skills. The primary focus was on implementing and comparing two models: a Logistic Regression model and an LSTM-based neural network model. While the LSTM model showed significant improvements over the Logistic Regression model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, practical usage of the chatbot indicated that suggestion accuracy needs further improvement. Future work could focus on incorporating ither different neural network architectures and introducing different mechanisms to generate and compare the misspelled words dataset, to enhance the model accuracy.
