    "    \"The Japanese have long been revered and studied for their long life expectancy, which is higher than almost anywhere else in the world.\",\n",
    "    \"So why is the traditional Japanese diet so healthy and what do they eat?\",\n",
    "    \"The traditional Japanese diet is largely fresh and unprocessed, with very few refined ingredients and sugar\",\n",
    "    \"In fact, it isn’t that dissimilar to a traditional Chinese diet, with staples including rice, cooked and pickled vegetables, fish and meat\",\n",
    "    \"However, because Japan is actually a group of islands (all 6,852 of them), its residents consume a lot more fish compared to other Asian countries.\",\n",
    "    \"They also eat raw fish in sushi and sashimi, plus quite a few pickled, fermented and smoked foods.\",\n",
    "    \"What are the components of a traditional Japanese diet?\",\n",
    "    \"Soya beans, usually in the form of tofu or fresh edamame, are a key part of the Japanese diet, along with other beans such as aduki.\",\n",
    "    \"Fermented soy bean products such as miso and natto are popular staples.\",\n",
    "    \"Natto is traditionally consumed at breakfast and has a beneficial effect on the gut and supports blood clotting.\",\n",
    "    \"The Japanese also consume a wide variety of land and sea vegetables including seaweed, which is packed full of health-boosting minerals, and may help to reduce blood pressure.\",\n",
    "    \"Fruit is often consumed with breakfast or as a dessert, especially Fuji apples, tangerines and persimmons.\",\n",
    "    \"Alongside their diet, the Japanese are big fans of green tea – in particular matcha tea, which is fast gaining popularity elsewhere, including the UK. Matcha, a stone-ground powdered green tea, is most valued for its high antioxidant compounds known as catechins, which have been linked to fighting cancer, viruses and heart disease.\",\n",
    "    \"a diet high in grains and vegetables, with moderate amounts of animal products and soy but minimal dairy and fruit – had a reduced risk of dying early from heart disease or stroke. \",\n",
    "    \"As their diet is traditionally high in soy and fish this may also play a significant role in reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.\",\n",
    "    \"The Japanese also have the lowest rates of obesity among men and women as well as long life expectancy.\",\n",
    "    \"The island of Okinawa, in southernmost Japan, has the highest number of centenarians in the world as well as the lowest risk of age-related diseases (for example diabetes, cancer, arthritis and Alzheimer’s).\",\n",
    "    \"This has partly been attributed to their traditional Japanese diet, which is low in calories and saturated fat yet high in nutrients, especially phytonutrients including flavonoids, found in different coloured vegetables.\",\n",
    "    \"This also includes phytoestrogens, or plant-based oestrogens, that may help protect against hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer.\",\n",
    "    \"The diet of the Okinawan people has been little influenced by the dietary changes of the Western culture, which have been seen in more urban Japan.\",\n",
    "    \"Traditionally, the Japanese tend to have a healthy attitude to food and eating.\",\n",
    "    \"They have a saying, “hara hachi bu”, which means to eat until you are 80 percents full, and it's not uncommon to teach children this philosophy from a young age.\",\n",
    "    \"The way the Japanese serve their food is also key. Rather than having one large plate, they often eat from a small bowl while enjoying several different dishes, usually rice, miso, some fish or meat and then two or three vegetables dishes, often served communally and eaten in rotation\",\n",
    "    \"The Japanese are also strong believers in ‘flexible restraint’ when it comes to treats and snacks, enjoying them from time to time but in smaller portions.\",\n",
    "    \"Do you use healthy ingredients in your kitchen? Is your cooking method calorie-free? Are you concerned about how much you eat? Japanese people take these aspects into account to maintain a healthy and fit lifestyle. It is why their foods are so nourishing yet delectable simultaneously.\",\n",
    "    \"Nevertheless, there are many secrets of the wholesome Japanese diet that not only protect them from several maladies but also delays their aging and prolongs a healthy lifespan. Here we are revealing the mystery of “Why Is Japanese Food So Healthy.” You can follow their diet for a hearty life.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese diet contains a significant portion of proteins and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, seafood, and plant-based products such as tofu, natto, and seaweed. They balance this nutritional component with carbohydrates and little fats for a balanced diet. Typically, Japonica short-grain rice provides most of the carbs; other significant sources are starchy vegetables and noodles.\",\n",
    "    \"Usually, the Japanese use raw seafood and fish in their meals rather than deep-frying them in much oil. Some unique cooking methods use minimal oil to stir-fry or cook beef, lamb, pork, and tempura. Moreover, fermented foods provide a rich source of vitamins and minerals. Japanese minimize salt and spices by employing various condiments, herbs, and sauces in their meals.\",\n",
    "    \"Traditional Japanese diets, such as the Okinawa diet, emphasized seafood for protein and healthy fats and sweet potatoes for carbohydrates. However, the modern Japanese diet, which has taken several influences from the West and China, comprises animal proteins and several processed condiments.\",\n",
    "    \"Components of the Japanese Diet\",\n",
    "    \"Soup: Japanese diet comprises many types of soup; miso soup is the most famous. This delectable and nourishing soup contains miso, seaweed, seafood, soybean, and vegetables. Moreover, many people add noodles to the soup to make it more filling.\",\n",
    "    \"Side Dishes: Japanese side dishes include vegetables and fruits that are either sauteed, boiled, steamed, stir-fried, grilled, or pickled.\",\n",
    "    \"Main Course Meal: Japanese main course meals usually contain poultry, beef, lamb, pork, seafood, and fish with either rice or noodles seasoned with herbs and condiments.\",\n",
    "    \"Staple Food: Japanese staple food revolves around rice and noodles, particularly ramen, soba, and udon noodles. Moreover, Japanese noodles are not unhealthy; they are made of healthy whole-grain flour such as wheat (udon) and buckwheat (soba).\",\n",
    "    \"The Key Ingredients  in Japanese Foods and Their Health Benefits. Japanese foods contain a high proportion of proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, good cholesterol, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Moreover, there is a limited portion of carbohydrates and sodium, which is why the incidence of cardiac diseases in Japan is the least.\",\n",
    "    \"Fish and Seafood. Famous kinds of fish in Japanese meals are tuna, salmon, mackerel, and pacific saury. Moreover, seafood varieties include uni (sea urchin), shrimp, unagi (eel), scallops, squid, and octopus. These foods contain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B2, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, iodine, and zinc.\",\n",
    "    \"Omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA are highly beneficial for the vitality of the heart and brain health. They prevent cardiac and cerebral issues like heart attack and stroke. Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids are excellent for reducing inflammation and depression and improving temporary memory problems (dementia).\",\n",
    "    \"Plant-based Products (Fruits, Vegetables, Tofu, Natto, and Seaweed). Popular Japanese fruits include persimmon, mandarin, fig, kiwi, sudachi, yuzu, kumquat, peach, plum, grapes, melon, pear, and apple. These fruits are rich in antioxidants to help fight against free radicals and vitamins C, A, B, and E, required for the normal functioning of the human body. Japanese consume these fruits as snacks, for breakfast, as side dishes, and for desserts which they consume much less.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese side dishes and main course meals comprise a lot of nutritious vegetables like onions, scallions, daikon radishes, carrots, sweet potatoes, and sweet corn. Moreover, they prepare these veggies by either boiling, steaming, grilling, pickling, or stir-frying using minimal oil. These plant-based foods are rich in vitamins and minerals and provide a good source of carbohydrates and dietary fiber. This insoluble fiber is a superfood for gut health. It is a lubricant to soften stool and prevent constipation, the mother of diseases.\",\n",
    "    \"Tofu, the soybean curd, is a rich protein and dietary fiber source. It is a gluten-free and low-calorie food excellent for colonic health (colon- part of the digestive system). It also prevents the risk of colonic cancers and IBS/IBD (inflammatory bowel syndrome/disease).\",\n",
    "    \"Another soybean product, natto, is the result of the fermentation of soybeans and is packed with proteins and probiotics. Furthermore, seaweed is quite popular in Japanese meals; it is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, particularly iodine. Seaweed is a fantastic food for normal thyroid functioning.\",\n",
    "    \"Animal Proteins (Beef, Lamb, Pork, and Poultry). Beef, lamb, pork, and poultry are rich sources of proteins; one should still prefer poultry and fish to red meat. Red meat is high in cholesterol and can increase the risk of heart attacks, coronary artery diseases, and strokes. It is why the Japanese prefer fish, seafood, and plant-based proteins over animal ones. In short, you can take red meat with caution (limited portion and often).\",\n",
    "    \"Good Fats and Unsaturated Vegetable Oils. Japanese use good fats and unsaturated oils for cooking. About 81% of Japanese use olive oil and sesame oil due to the plethora of health benefits. These oils are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. They prevent heart diseases and diabetes, regulate cholesterol levels, and assist in losing body weight.\",\n",
    "    \"Japonica rice and Japanese Noodles. Japanese rice and noodles make up a significant portion of their carbohydrate intake. They use white short-grain rice for dishes such as donburi, sushi, Tai-meshi, battera, and tokaraisu. However, Japanese noodles such as udon and soba are made of wheat and buckwheat, containing all essential nutrients.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese Fermented Food. Japanese prefer fermented foods as condiments over spices and salt to keep them healthy and fit. These include natto, miso, shoyu, umeboshi, katsuobushi, and tsukemono. Moreover, these fermented foods are rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\",\n",
    "    \"Green Teas. Popular Japanese green teas are matcha, sencha, genmaicha, bancha, gyokuro, tencha, and hojicha. These antioxidants help fight free radicals, prevent aging, and prolong a healthy lifespan.\",\n",
    "    \"What Type of Foods Do Japanese Take In Moderation? Japanese limit the use of dairy products, red meat, eggs, bakery goods, and sugary foods to keep them healthy since these foods contain a high proportion of simple carbs and sugars.\",\n",
    "    \"Why Is the Japanese Diet So Healthy? Japanese diet mainly relies on plants and seafood for proteins,  good fats, vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, they take a limited portion of carbohydrates, spices, and salt. Such a diet prevents them from getting harmful diseases, delays aging, and prolongs their healthy lifespan.\",\n",
    "    \"Can You Lose Weight on a Japanese Diet? Yes, you can lose weight on a Japanese diet because the meals are rich in proteins, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, Japanese foods have a small portion of carbohydrates and fats.\",\n",
    "    \"The Secrets of Why Do Japanese Live Longer?\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese foods are healthy since they are packed with all the essential nutrients the human body requires for normal functioning.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese eat slowly to help digest food quickly and get the nutrients to absorb maximally.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese prefer green teas and herbal drinks enriched in antioxidants over carbonated beverages.\",\n",
    "    \"They control the portion size of their meals and eat several times a day.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese never skip breakfast, and their breakfast is highly nourishing.\",\n",
    "    \"They eat much fewer desserts compared to other countries.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese foods are healthy because of their cooking methods, e.g., boiling, steaming, grilling, broiling, stir-frying, and fermenting.\",\n",
    "    \"They eat rice and noodles instead of bread made of refined flour.\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese fermented foods are rich in soy proteins, which regulate hormonal balance and promote a healthy lifestyle.\",\n",
    "    \"I was born and raised in the American Midwest, but love visiting my parents' homeland in Japan. Central to every trip there is always the food: Oh my goodness, the food.\",\n",
    "    \"Eating is a raging national obsession here, with good reason. Staggering varieties of food are available everywhere; it's all delicious and — most impressively, to me — always fresh.\",\n",
    "    \"Soba noodles come made to order, with flash-fried seasonal tempura vegetables. Mouthwatering sushi and curry rice lunches are sold on train platforms. You can wander past cases of specialty foods, from marbled meats to miso-pickled vegetables to handmade gyoza dumplings, in the depa chicka, or department store basements.\",\n",
    "    \"There's a slavish devotion to the gourmet that might seem crazy anywhere else. In summer months, domestic peaches come boxed in cushions to protect flesh as delicate as a baby's cheek.\",\n",
    "    \"What's remarkable about Japan is that food like this is available almost everywhere you turn, yet obesity is not the public health threat it is in the U.S.\",\n",
    "    \"Both the U.S. and Japan are wealthy industrialized countries, but they occupy opposite ends of the obesity spectrum. Currently, 43% of the U.S. population has obesity — nearly 10 times Japan's rate of 4.5%.\",\n",
    "    \"I ask Terry Huang, a health policy professor at the City University of New York, about the apparent contradiction in Japan's relationship with food. He says there are various reasons, most of which are rooted in Japan's cultural history. He says Japan — and Asian countries generally — place greater emphasis on health and longevity, as compared to convenience, say, or instant gratification.\",\n",
    "    \"Traditional Japanese cuisine centers around vegetables, soy products like miso, and seaweed or seafood, making it naturally high in fiber and good fats.\",\n",
    "    \"'It may be hard to quantify, but qualitatively it's important because it influences much of how we design our communities, how we think about food, how we engage in lifestyle behaviors in general,' he says.\",\n",
    "    \"In other words, the fundamental construct of life in Japan makes it easier to live healthier. Huang calls this 'default design' and he says it literally comes built in: The fact that Japanese cities are densely populated, but safe, allows for heavy reliance on public transport, for example. And populations that use public transport tend to walk more and get more exercise just by virtue of that design.\",\n",
    "    \"My 74-year-old mother tells me errands are her primary form of exercise; the incidental walking from doing chores and shopping naturally adds up. I documented that during my trip: I spent eight days shadowing my parents, who live in central Tokyo, and my Apple watch fitness tracker showed I walked an average of over 6 miles a day, which is 60% more than I typically do living in the suburbs.\",\n",
    "    \"Public transportation is widely available in Japan and it increases physical activity, compared to commuting by car\",\n",
    "    \"Japanese cities are built around public transportation, which encourages more movement, and increases exercise across the population.\",\n",
    "    \"That's why default design is so powerful. It bakes healthy habits into daily life. Huang says that's critical because otherwise healthy behavior becomes less automatic, and more dependent on individual effort. 'Any time you add additional burden in planning for a healthy meal or going to exercise, that's going to translate into a lower likelihood of people actually engaging,' he says.\",\n",
    "    \"I realized that's true even when it comes to food; Japan has a kind of default design that supports healthier eating. It stems from a traditional diet that leans heavily on vegetables, seaweed and seafood. But it also is embedded into the culture of eating there, Huang says.\",\n",
    "    \"'Culturally, when it comes to food, there is a stronger emphasis on quality and refinement in the preparation of each dish as opposed to quantity,' he says.\",\n",
    "    \"It's true even for things the Japanese consider fast food, like one of the Tokyo ramen stalls I ducked into with my mother on a recent visit.\",\n",
    "    \"Across the serving counter, we watched the chef draw broth from fish flakes and pork bones. He ladled the soup onto noodles and a thin slice of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, topped off with nori, or seaweed. The result was savory, nourishing, and cost less than $5.\",\n",
    "    \"I think my favorite example that shows the contrast with the U.S. is Japanese convenience store food. There is no market for supersized slushies here, or day-old hot dogs cooked on rollers. Japanese convenience stories, called conbini, feature refrigerated walls of noodle salads, rice balls, bento boxes, all perfectly portioned and delicious, if you ask me.\",\n",
    "    \"Again, there's an adherence to freshness: Instead of using preservatives and stabilizers as so much processed food in the U.S. does, manufactures print sell-by labels on each package that are time-stamped to the minute. Unsold wares are tracked and swapped out multiple times a day.\",\n",
    "    \"This is not to say Japan is immune to industrialized and ultra-processed food trends driving up obesity rates worldwide. Excess weight is a growing concern here, too. Yet the population is remarkably resilient in the face of that global trend.\",\n",
    "    \"Why? One key factor my mom reminds me of — and many researchers point to — is the Japanese school lunch. It is free, scratch-made and balanced, but that isn't all. Starting in elementary school, lunchtime itself is treated like a class in nutrition, says Michiko Tomioka, a Japanese nutritionist based in New Jersey. Kids serve each other food, help with clean up, and are encouraged to eat everything they're given.\",\n",
    "    \"This lunchtime ritual establishes a common cultural understanding about what healthy eating looks like. Tomioka says. And that's how it also becomes a habit that endures.\",\n",
    "    \"I often think how revolutionary it would be for my life raising two teenage sons, if I had a Japanese conbini within walking distance from my house in suburban Washington DC. Most days, I try to adhere to a Japanese approach to food, which is actually an almost impossible commitment to keep, especially as a working solo parent.\",\n",
    "    \"It means driving, regularly, to half a dozen different grocery or specialty stores to stock fresh ingredients, like shrimp, dried seaweed (nori), or produce like Japanese yams and chives, then setting aside time throughout the day to wash, chop, cook and clean. (I also keep a small garden.) There is no other option I know of yet that meets my three golden criteria — healthy, economical and delicious.\",\n",
    "    \"I'm prone to griping: Why must eating fresh require taking on what feels like a second or third job? Many parent friends of mine seem to regard my efforts as laudable, maybe, but lunatic.\",\n",
    "    \"The reality is, I'm extremely lucky; there are so many privileges implicit in being able to prioritize fresh eating or healthy living in America. Modern life affords few families the time, money or access to the kinds of things I'm able to do (at least sometimes).\",\n",
    "    \"In three years covering health, I've come to understand how so many of the health problems in America stem from inequities that begin, at core, with what we grew up eating and the lifestyle we lived. So I also wonder how much better off we might be, as a population, if living or eating well wasn't a burden we placed on individuals, but something our society supported — by design.\",\n",
    "    \"Not only do the Japanese have a high average life expectancy, but they also have some of the healthiest, most independent long-lived people in the world. Once could say that this longevity is backed by the Japanese diet, while takes advantage of the rich variety of ingredients found in the seas, mountains, and fields of Japan.\",\n",
    "    \"Over many years, human beings have adapted to the dietary environments of the regions where they live. Let’s take a look at how people have been affected by these dietary environments and the places they were born and brought up in.\",\n",
    "    \"Compared to Caucasian people, Japanese people tend to develop hardening of the arteries later in life. However, it is reported that second-generation Japanese raised in Hawaii develop this condition earlier in life, and by the third generation, the difference to Caucasian people almost completely vanishes. Research into the rates of cancer development also show that from the second generation, there is a greater number of sufferers. It is speculated that this is because unlike their parents’ generation, the children and grandchildren of those immigrants have synchronized to the dietary lifestyles of where they live.\",\n",
    "    \"In the case of Americans of Japanese descent, cancer rates increased, and in Brazil, the switch to a meat-focused diet saw an increase in incidence of heart attacks, with statistics showing at least a 10-year drop in average life expectancy.\",\n",
    "    \"As there are multiple research reports showing that the adoption of Western dietary habits by immigrants of Japanese descent increases the rate of lifestyle diseases and shortens life expectancy, people have come to believe that Japanese diets are more healthy and lead to longer lives.\",\n",
    "    \"The mother’s milk of mammals contains lactose. Baby mammals break down this lactose into glucose and galactose to absorb it, using a catabolic enzyme called lactase. However, after the weaning period, they lose the ability to secrete lactase within the body, and become unable to break down lactose. This is why a considerable number of Japanese suffer effects such as diarrhea or upset stomachs as a result of drinking milk.\",\n",
    "    \"However, Europeans continue to be able to secrete lactase within the body even as adults. It is believed that their ancestors’ bodies adapted to living in cold environments where it was difficult to grow grains, which forced them to adopt a dietary lifestyle that depended on dairy products and meat to survive. Proportion of adults incapable of digesting lactose among indigenous peoples of the Old World (excluding America)\",\n",
    "    \"One could say that human bodies adapt to the food of the region where they live, and continue to change as a result. Even European research to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet, well-known for its healthy qualities, has shown that there are differences in its effectiveness per country.\",\n",
    "    \"Yojo Kun is a health manual (a healthcare regimen) authored by the Confucian scholar Ekiken Kaibara during the Edo period (1603–1868). While the average life expectancy during this period was around 40 years old, Kaibara wrote the manual at the ripe old age of 83. To this day, Yojo Kun contains numerous messages that are still valid to this day, serving as a lifestyle manual that provides not only a healthcare regimen for the body, but also for the mind.\",\n",
    "    \"'The first step to health is cultivation of one’s mind. Keep the heart from suffering and keep the spirit free from harm by being calm and peaceful, refraining from anger and greed, and restraining melancholy and worry—these are important methods to cultivating one’s mind.' (Volume 1, 9)\",\n",
    "    \"'In all meals, favor plain, lightly-flavored things. One must not eat many rich, fatty foods.' (Volume 3, 6); 'Eating until one is full will cause bitter misfortune.' (Volume 3, 8); 'By eating sufficient amounts of foods with each of the five flavors, one can avoid illness. Even if one eats a variety of meats or vegetables, continuing to eat the same things will cause those foods to stagnate in the body and inflict harm.' (Volume 3, 9) \",\n",
    "    \"Yojo Kun mentions “illness starts from the mouth,' 'eating and drinking in moderation,' and 'eating and drinking until eight-tenths full' (idiomatically, also eating and drinking in moderation) on numerous occasions when admonishing against overeating, making it clear that these are important principles. Modern dietary manuals also have their foundations in these principles.\",\n",
    "    \"There are five thoughts when eating. (Volume 3, 18) The five thoughts: Gratitude to the person who provided the food. Thoughts for the labor of the people connected to the food. Happiness at being able to eat something that tastes good, despite one’s own lack of aptitude, virtue, or outstanding actions or deeds. Happiness at being able to eat enough, while others starve. Thoughts for one’s ancient ancestors, who unable to grow staple crops, evaded starvation by eating fruits, berries, and roots\",\n",
    "    \"These five thoughts are present in the phrases itadakimasu (“I humbly receive”) and gochisosama desu (“It was a treat”), which the Japanese say before and after a meal respectively, and perhaps they will serve to help understand and pass on Japanese dietary culture.\",\n",
    "    \"The Japanese diet receives global attention, as it is seen as good for one’s health. There are various kinds of research taking place to examine what kinds of positive effects it has on the body. Here, rather than looking at the nutritional value of the individual ingredients of the Japanese diet, we’ll be looking at the health benefits of the Japanese diet by evaluating diets in their entirety.\",\n",
    "    \"In the same way that Japan has the Japanese diet, other countries each have their own traditional diets. In an experiment to compare the Japanese and American diets using rats, it was found that the Japanese diet has the health benefits of energizing carbohydrate/lipid metabolisms, low stress on organs and low oxidative stress, and excretion of cholesterol. Because there was no conspicuous difference in PFC (protein, fat, and carbohydrates) balance between the Japanese and American diets, it is thought that the reason why Japanese diets had the above benefits may be due to qualitative differences, for example what kinds of ingredients were consumed.\",\n",
    "    \"Rice. Dried daikon strips and kombu with dressing. Pork fried with ginger. Miso soup\",\n",
    "    \"Bread. Pork and beans. Salad. Desert. Coffee. Cola\",\n",
    "    \"The Japanese diet was based on the 1999 National Nutrition Survey, while the American diet was based on the 1996 USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. These were used as references to create breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus for a week each. The above shows part of the dinner menus.\",\n",
    "    \"While the Japanese diet has been inherited as a tradition, it has still changed as time passed. In an experiment to compare current and past Japanese diets using mice, it was found that the 1975 diet had the notable features of reducing the risk of obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes, as well as anti-aging and longevity-extending effects. There were no conspicuous differences in the nutritional composition for the diet from each period, so it is inferred that, like the comparison between Japanese and American diets, these features arise from qualitative differences.\",\n",
    "    \"One could say that this period was a time when the Japanese diet had started to Westernize slightly. Let’s take a look at five features of the 1975 Japanese diet, which had evolved to become the healthiest of the four diets chosen.\",\n",
    "    \"Diversity. Small amounts of various ingredients. At least three items of main and side dishes combined.\",\n",
    "    \"Preparation. Prioritization of simmered, steamed, and raw foods. Following these, boiled and roasted/broiled foods, then deep-fried and fried foods.\",\n",
    "    \"Ingredients. Strong intake of soy products, seafood, vegetables (including pickles), fruit, seaweed, mushrooms, and green tea. Moderate amounts of egg, dairy, and meat.\",\n",
    "    \"Seasonings. Careful use of dashi and fermented seasonings (soy sauce, miso, vinegar, mirin, sake) and limited intake of sugar and salt.\",\n",
